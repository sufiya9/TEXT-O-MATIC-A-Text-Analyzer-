A fox lived in a  forest. One day, he was very hungry. It was a hot summer day. He went out of his place and wandered here and there. He is looking up for some food. He visited many places in search of food. Finally, he found a vineyard a mile away. 


He ran and reached there. He saw a chubby bear near the vineyard. The chubby bear asked him politely, â€œWhere are you going?'' The hungry fox glared at him. The chubby bear again tried to ask him the same but before he could complete his question, the ravenous fox entered into the vineyard.


He saw the multicoloured bunches of grapes in the vineyard. He was amazed and became very happy. His mouth started watering. He wished to eat all at once. He jumped to catch the grapes and tried to eat them. But he got nothing, not even a single bunch. He was not close enough to any branch.
